A. ORIGIN OF THIS LICENSE
=========================
This license is based almost completely on the Python License (for 
Python 2.3) created by the Python Software Foundation. 
Being derived from this, the license is compatible with the GPL.
Note:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing this software
    under the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you 
    distribute a modified version without making your changes open 
    source.  This GPL-compatible license makes it possible to combine 
    this software with other software that is released under the GPL.

The end goal of this license is to allow the system to be distributed
as part of the PSF's python distribution.

B. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THIS SOFTWARE
